## Contextual Recommendations

### Task-Based Agent Suggestions
```typescript
interface TaskRecommendation {
  task: string;
  primaryAgent: string;
  supportingAgents: string[];
  context: string;
  workflow: string[];
}

// Example recommendations based on codebase analysis
const recommendations = {
  newFeature: {
    task: "Adding user authentication",
    primaryAgent: "developer",
    supportingAgents: ["architect", "design-system"],
    context: "Existing auth patterns found in /lib/auth/",
    workflow: [
      "1. Review existing auth implementation with architect",
      "2. Design auth components with design-system agent", 
      "3. Implement with developer agent using established patterns",
      "4. Test integration with existing user management"
    ]
  },
  
  performance: {
    task: "Optimizing bundle size",
    primaryAgent: "analyst",
    supportingAgents: ["developer", "quality-monitor"],
    context: "Bundle currently 2.3MB, opportunities in vendor chunks",
    workflow: [
      "1. Run performance audit with analyst agent",
      "2. Identify optimization opportunities",
      "3. Implement code splitting with developer agent",
      "4. Monitor improvements with quality-monitor"
    ]
  }
};
```

### Code Example Extraction
```typescript
// Extract relevant code patterns for AI agents
function extractRelevantExamples(task: string, codebase: CodebaseAnalysis) {
  const examples = {
    components: [],
    patterns: [],
    utilities: [],
    tests: []
  };
  
  // Find similar components for UI tasks
  if (task.includes('component') || task.includes('UI')) {
    examples.components = codebase.areas.components
      .filter(comp => comp.type === 'UI')
      .slice(0, 3); // Most relevant examples
  }
  
  // Find API patterns for backend tasks
  if (task.includes('API') || task.includes('endpoint')) {
    examples.patterns = codebase.areas.apis
      .map(api => api.implementation)
      .slice(0, 2);
  }
  
  return examples;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### New Team Member Onboarding
```
I'm new to this React codebase and need to understand:
- Overall architecture and patterns
- How to add new components
- Testing approach
- Development workflow
```

**My Analysis**:
```markdown
# Codebase Analysis for New Developer

## Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: React 18 + Next.js 13 with App Router
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React hooks for local
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

## Component Patterns
Your team follows these consistent patterns:
- Components in `/components/ui/` with TypeScript interfaces
- Custom hooks in `/hooks/` for reusable logic
- Design system tokens in `/styles/tokens.css`

## Recommended Workflow
1. Start with `@agents/core/architect.md` to understand architecture
2. Use `@agents/design/design-system.md` for UI components
3. Use `@agents/core/developer.md` for implementation

## Key Examples Found
- Button component: `/components/ui/button.tsx`
- Form patterns: `/components/forms/`
- API utilities: `/lib/api/`
```

### Feature Development Planning
```
I want to add a real-time chat feature to our SaaS app.
Need to understand existing patterns and plan implementation.
```

**My Recommendations**:
```markdown
# Real-time Chat Feature Analysis

## Existing Infrastructure
- **WebSocket Support**: Found Socket.io setup in `/lib/socket/`
- **User Management**: Auth system supports user sessions
- **UI Patterns**: Message-like components in `/components/notifications/`

## Recommended Agents & Workflow
1. **Architect Agent**: Plan chat architecture integration
   - Context: Existing WebSocket infrastructure
   - Focus: Real-time data flow and state management

2. **Design System Agent**: Create chat UI components
   - Context: Existing notification and card components
   - Focus: Message bubbles, chat input, user avatars

3. **Developer Agent**: Implement chat functionality
   - Context: Socket.io patterns in `/lib/socket/`
   - Focus: Message persistence, real-time updates

## Code Examples to Reference
- WebSocket connection: `/lib/socket/connection.ts`
- Real-time notifications: `/components/notifications/toast.tsx`
- User state management: `/stores/user-store.ts`
```

### Technical Debt Assessment
```
Analyze our codebase for technical debt and improvement opportunities.
Focus on performance and maintainability issues.
```

**My Assessment**:
```markdown
# Technical Debt Analysis

## High Priority Issues
1. **Bundle Size**: 2.8MB total (target: <1MB)
   - Recommendation: Use `@agents/project/audit.md` for optimization
   - Found: Large vendor chunks, unused dependencies

2. **TypeScript Coverage**: 67% (target: >90%)
   - Recommendation: Use `@agents/core/developer.md` for gradual typing
   - Found: `/utils/` and `/lib/legacy/` need attention

## Code Quality Findings
- **Test Coverage**: 54% (target: >80%)
- **Component Complexity**: 12 components exceed complexity threshold
- **Documentation**: API endpoints lack documentation

## Recommended Action Plan
1. Performance optimization with analyst agent
2. TypeScript migration with developer agent  
3. Test coverage improvement with quality-monitor
4. Documentation with design-system agent
```
