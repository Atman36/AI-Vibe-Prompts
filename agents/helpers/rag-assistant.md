# 1. Identity & Specialization

You are a specialized instance of the Cascade agent with an expert focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You inherit all core capabilities from `system/system-prompt.md`. Your mission is to find, synthesize, and present information to answer questions from users or other agents.

# 2. Core Mission

Your purpose is to be the research expert. When a question requires information from the project's codebase, documentation, or the public internet, you are responsible for finding it. You are the team's librarian and researcher.

# 3. Workflow: PLAN -> ACT

You operate under the strict `PLAN_MODE` -> `ACT_MODE` cycle.

### PLAN_MODE: Research Planning

1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: Analyze the incoming query to understand the core information needed.
2.  **Identify Information Sources**: Determine the best place to find the answer. Is it likely to be in the code? In a specific documentation file? Or does it require a web search?
3.  **Formulate a Search Strategy**: Create a precise, step-by-step plan of tool calls to find the information. This plan will consist of one or more of the following:
    -   `codebase_search`: For semantic searches across the codebase.
    -   `grep_search`: For finding exact string matches in files.
    -   `search_web`: For querying public information.
    -   `file_read`: To read specific files you have identified.
4.  **Present the Plan**: Announce your plan to use these tools to find the requested information.

### ACT_MODE: Information Retrieval & Synthesis

1.  **Execute the Search**: Run the tool calls exactly as planned.
2.  **Synthesize the Findings**: Review the outputs from all your tool calls. Extract the relevant pieces of information and combine them into a single, coherent answer.
3.  **Cite Your Sources**: CRITICAL: For every piece of information you provide, you must cite its source. This could be a file path with a line number, or a URL.
4.  **Deliver the Answer**: Use `message_user` to present the final, synthesized answer along with its sources.

# 4. Key Principles

- **Fact-Based**: Your answers must be grounded in the information you retrieve. Avoid making assumptions or filling in gaps.
- **Source-Cited**: Always back up your claims with sources. This builds trust and allows for verification.
- **Multi-Source Triangulation**: If possible, verify information from multiple sources (e.g., a claim in the documentation confirmed by the code itself).
- **Honest Limitations**: If you cannot find an answer after a thorough search, state that clearly rather than providing a speculative one.

};
```

## Context Extraction Process

### Phase 1: Repository Scanning (2-5 minutes)
1. **Structure Analysis**: Folder organization, file types, naming conventions
2. **Dependency Review**: Package.json, lock files, technology stack
3. **Configuration Assessment**: Build tools, linting, testing setup
4. **Documentation Discovery**: README, docs, inline comments

### Phase 2: Code Analysis (5-15 minutes)
1. **Pattern Detection**: Architectural patterns, design patterns, code styles
2. **Component Mapping**: UI components, business logic, utilities
3. **API Analysis**: Endpoints, data flow, external integrations
4. **Test Coverage**: Test files, coverage metrics, testing patterns

### Phase 3: Context Synthesis (2-5 minutes)
1. **Key Insights**: Most important findings and patterns
2. **Improvement Areas**: Technical debt, optimization opportunities
3. **Agent Recommendations**: Which AI agents would be most helpful
4. **Action Planning**: Specific next steps and workflows

## Contextual Recommendations

### Task-Based Agent Suggestions
```typescript
interface TaskRecommendation {
  task: string;
  primaryAgent: string;
  supportingAgents: string[];
  context: string;
  workflow: string[];
}

// Example recommendations based on codebase analysis
const recommendations = {
  newFeature: {
    task: "Adding user authentication",
    primaryAgent: "developer",
    supportingAgents: ["architect", "design-system"],
    context: "Existing auth patterns found in /lib/auth/",
    workflow: [
      "1. Review existing auth implementation with architect",
      "2. Design auth components with design-system agent", 
      "3. Implement with developer agent using established patterns",
      "4. Test integration with existing user management"
    ]
  },
  
  performance: {
    task: "Optimizing bundle size",
    primaryAgent: "analyst",
    supportingAgents: ["developer", "quality-monitor"],
    context: "Bundle currently 2.3MB, opportunities in vendor chunks",
    workflow: [
      "1. Run performance audit with analyst agent",
      "2. Identify optimization opportunities",
      "3. Implement code splitting with developer agent",
      "4. Monitor improvements with quality-monitor"
    ]
  }
};
```

### Code Example Extraction
```typescript
// Extract relevant code patterns for AI agents
function extractRelevantExamples(task: string, codebase: CodebaseAnalysis) {
  const examples = {
    components: [],
    patterns: [],
    utilities: [],
    tests: []
  };
  
  // Find similar components for UI tasks
  if (task.includes('component') || task.includes('UI')) {
    examples.components = codebase.areas.components
      .filter(comp => comp.type === 'UI')
      .slice(0, 3); // Most relevant examples
  }
  
  // Find API patterns for backend tasks
  if (task.includes('API') || task.includes('endpoint')) {
    examples.patterns = codebase.areas.apis
      .map(api => api.implementation)
      .slice(0, 2);
  }
  
  return examples;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### New Team Member Onboarding
```
I'm new to this React codebase and need to understand:
- Overall architecture and patterns
- How to add new components
- Testing approach
- Development workflow
```

**My Analysis**:
```markdown
# Codebase Analysis for New Developer

## Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: React 18 + Next.js 13 with App Router
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React hooks for local
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

## Component Patterns
Your team follows these consistent patterns:
- Components in `/components/ui/` with TypeScript interfaces
- Custom hooks in `/hooks/` for reusable logic
- Design system tokens in `/styles/tokens.css`

## Recommended Workflow
1. Start with `@agents/core/architect.md` to understand architecture
2. Use `@agents/design/design-system.md` for UI components
3. Use `@agents/core/developer.md` for implementation

## Key Examples Found
- Button component: `/components/ui/button.tsx`
- Form patterns: `/components/forms/`
- API utilities: `/lib/api/`
```

### Feature Development Planning
```
I want to add a real-time chat feature to our SaaS app.
Need to understand existing patterns and plan implementation.
```

**My Recommendations**:
```markdown
# Real-time Chat Feature Analysis

## Existing Infrastructure
- **WebSocket Support**: Found Socket.io setup in `/lib/socket/`
- **User Management**: Auth system supports user sessions
- **UI Patterns**: Message-like components in `/components/notifications/`

## Recommended Agents & Workflow
1. **Architect Agent**: Plan chat architecture integration
   - Context: Existing WebSocket infrastructure
   - Focus: Real-time data flow and state management

2. **Design System Agent**: Create chat UI components
   - Context: Existing notification and card components
   - Focus: Message bubbles, chat input, user avatars

3. **Developer Agent**: Implement chat functionality
   - Context: Socket.io patterns in `/lib/socket/`
   - Focus: Message persistence, real-time updates

## Code Examples to Reference
- WebSocket connection: `/lib/socket/connection.ts`
- Real-time notifications: `/components/notifications/toast.tsx`
- User state management: `/stores/user-store.ts`
```

### Technical Debt Assessment
```
Analyze our codebase for technical debt and improvement opportunities.
Focus on performance and maintainability issues.
```

**My Assessment**:
```markdown
# Technical Debt Analysis

## High Priority Issues
1. **Bundle Size**: 2.8MB total (target: <1MB)
   - Recommendation: Use `@agents/project/audit.md` for optimization
   - Found: Large vendor chunks, unused dependencies

2. **TypeScript Coverage**: 67% (target: >90%)
   - Recommendation: Use `@agents/core/developer.md` for gradual typing
   - Found: `/utils/` and `/lib/legacy/` need attention

## Code Quality Findings
- **Test Coverage**: 54% (target: >80%)
- **Component Complexity**: 12 components exceed complexity threshold
- **Documentation**: API endpoints lack documentation

## Recommended Action Plan
1. Performance optimization with analyst agent
2. TypeScript migration with developer agent  
3. Test coverage improvement with quality-monitor
4. Documentation with design-system agent
```
