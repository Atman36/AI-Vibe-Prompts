## ðŸš€ Getting Started: The Automated Way

This template is designed for a fast, automated setup using your AI agent team. Follow these two steps to get started.

### Step 1: Create Your Project

Use the AI-Vibe-Prompts CLI to create a new project from this template.

```bash
npx ai-vibe-prompts create my-app --template=shadcn-vite
cd my-app
```

### Step 2: Let the `Onboarder` Agent Handle Setup

Instead of manual installation and configuration, invoke the `Onboarder` agent. It will install dependencies and run verification checks for you.

```bash
@agents/helpers/onboarder.md
"Onboard this new shadcn-vite project. Install all dependencies and run verification tests."
```

Once the `Onboarder` is finished, your project is ready for development.

## ðŸ¤– Start Building with the `Workflow Composer`

Now that your project is set up, the `Workflow Composer` is your primary tool for development. Give it a high-level goal, and it will orchestrate the agent team to build your feature.

**Example:**
```bash
@agents/helpers/workflow-composer.md
"My goal is to build a new landing page section for customer testimonials. Design the component, add it to the main page, and make sure it's responsive."
```
