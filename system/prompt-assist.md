# Guide to Creating Effective Prompts

## Part 1: Fundamental Principles of Creating Effective Prompts

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

-   **Essence**: Models cannot read minds. Formulate prompts as clearly, detailed, and unambiguously as possible. Avoid vague or general requests that can lead to irrelevant or erroneous answers.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   Use simple, direct, and understandable language. Avoid complex terminology or jargon unless it is specific to the task.
    -   Clearly define the task using action verbs (e.g., "describe", "compare", "generate", "summarize", "classify").
    -   Specify concrete details that should be taken into account.
-   **Example**:
    -   **Vague Prompt**: "Tell me about dogs."
    -   **Specific Prompt**: "Describe three key characteristics of the Labrador Retriever breed and their significance for a dog owner, in a bulleted list format."

### 2. Providing Context and Relevance

-   **Essence**: Context helps the model better understand your request and provide a more accurate and meaningful answer. Linking the prompt to relevant documents, data, or scenarios ensures that the model has the necessary background information.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   Provide the model with all necessary background information that may influence the answer.
    -   If your request is related to a specific text, document, or previous discussion, indicate this.
    -   Refer to existing documents, knowledge bases, or specific sections of text to substantiate the prompt.
-   **Example**:
    -   **Without Context**: "How to improve the product?"
    -   **With Context**: "Based on user feedback from the last quarter (see document 'Q3 Feedback'), propose three concrete improvements for the user interface of our mobile application."

### 3. Defining the Model's Role (Persona)

-   **Essence**: Assigning a specific role to the model helps set the right tone, style, and depth of response.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   Clearly state who the model should act as (e.g., "You are an experienced marketer", "Act as a scientific editor", "Imagine you are a historian").
-   **Example**:
    -   "As a cybersecurity expert, explain in simple terms what phishing is and how to protect against it."

### 4. Using Examples (One-Shot, Few-Shot Learning)

-   **Essence**: Demonstrating the expected format, style, or type of response through examples significantly improves generation quality.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   **One-Shot**: Provide one example of the desired output.
    -   **Few-Shot**: Provide several examples. This is especially useful for complex tasks or when a specific response pattern is required.
    -   Ensure that examples are high-quality, relevant to the task, and cover possible variations, including edge cases.

### 5. Formulating Clear Instructions

-   **Essence**: *How* you give instructions is as important as *what* you ask for. Clear, positive, and well-structured instructions guide the model to the desired outcome.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   **Place instructions at the beginning of the prompt**: This helps the model immediately understand the main task before delving into details or context.
    -   **Use positive phrasing**: Tell the model what to *do*, not what to *avoid*. For example, instead of "Don't write a long text" use "Write a brief summary (1-2 sentences)".
    -   **Use delimiters**: Use symbols like `---`, `###`, or simply empty lines to clearly separate instructions from context, examples, or input data. This improves readability and helps the model distinguish different parts of the prompt.
    -   **Break down complex tasks into smaller, clear steps or instructions**: If the task is multi-component, list the steps the model should perform.
-   **Example**:
    ```
    ### Instruction ###
    You are a scientific journal editor. Your task is to edit the following paragraph, correcting grammatical errors and improving readability. Maintain a scientific style.

    ### Original Text ###
    [Text to edit]

    ### Edited Text ###
    ```

### 6. Controlling Output Format

-   **Essence**: Explicitly stating the desired response format (e.g., JSON, XML, list, table, paragraph of specific length) makes the result more predictable, structured, and convenient for further use, especially in automated systems. This can also reduce the likelihood of model "hallucinations".
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   Directly ask the model to use a specific format: "Respond in JSON format", "Present the data as a bulleted list", "Write the answer in two paragraphs".
    -   If a complex structured format is needed, provide an example structure (e.g., a JSON template with keys).

### 7. Chain of Thought (CoT)

-   **Essence**: This technique encourages the model to "think aloud," meaning to explain its reasoning step by step before giving a final answer. This is especially useful for tasks requiring logical inferences, mathematical calculations, or multi-stage analysis.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   Add a phrase to the prompt such as: "Explain your reasoning step by step", "Let's break this down step by step", or "Think aloud before giving the answer".
    -   Can be combined with few-shot prompting, where examples also include a demonstration of the chain of thought.
    -   **Tip**: For CoT, it is often recommended to set the "temperature" parameter to a low value (e.g., 0 or close to 0) for more deterministic and consistent reasoning.

### 8. Self-Consistency

-   **Essence**: This technique aims to increase the reliability of responses, especially for tasks where there may be multiple solution paths or where the model can be easily confused. It involves generating several response options for the same prompt (usually with a higher "temperature" for variety of reasoning), and then selecting the most frequent or consistent response.
-   **How to Apply**:
    1.  Formulate the prompt, preferably using the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) technique.
    2.  Generate several responses to this prompt, using a higher "temperature" (e.g., 0.5-0.7) to encourage different reasoning paths.
    3.  Analyze the received responses and select the one that occurs most frequently or is the most logical among the majority of options.

### 9. Step-Back Prompting Technique

-   **Essence**: Before solving a specific, highly specialized task, the model is asked to "step back" and formulate more general principles, concepts, or facts related to that task. These general insights are then used to generate a higher-quality and more grounded response to the original question.
-   **How to Apply**:
    1.  First, ask the model a general question to activate its basic knowledge in the relevant area.
    2.  Then, use the answer to this general question (or the general principles themselves) as context for solving a more specific task.
    -   This helps the model generate a deeper and more contextually rich response.

### 10. Breaking Down Complex Tasks into Subtasks

-   **Essence**: Instead of trying to solve one large and complex task with a single prompt, break it down into several smaller, manageable subtasks. Each subtask can be solved with a separate, more focused prompt, and the results can then be combined.
-   **How to Apply**:
    -   Analyze a complex task and identify logical stages or components.
    -   Formulate a separate prompt for each stage.
    -   The output of one stage can serve as input for the next.
-   **Example**:
    -   **Complex Task**: "Create a marketing campaign for a new eco-friendly detergent."
    -   **Subtasks and Separate Prompts**:
        1.  "Identify the target audience for a new eco-friendly detergent, considering its premium price and natural composition."
        2.  "Formulate 3 key messages for this target audience, emphasizing the unique benefits of the product."
        3.  "Suggest 5 promotion channels most suitable for reaching this audience with these messages."
        4.  "Develop an idea for one commercial (30 seconds) for one of the proposed channels."

✅ Break down complex tasks into clear step-by-step instructions to reduce ambiguity.

✅ Apply prompt engineering methods to solve various tasks such as summarization, transformation, and inference.

✅ Link your applications to specific model versions to ensure consistency.

✅ Avoid vague prompts and continuously test different variations.
