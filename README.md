> **An Autonomous AI-Agent Framework for Modern Web Development**

**AI-Vibe-Prompts** has evolved from a collection of prompts into a powerful, agent-driven framework. It provides a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to design, build, and maintain complex web applications, following a predictable, tool-based workflow.

## üéØ The New Paradigm: Agent-Driven Development

This framework introduces a structured, tool-first approach to AI-assisted development, moving beyond simple prompts to a robust system of autonomous agents.

- **From Prompts to Agents**: We've transformed descriptive markdown files into active, specialized agents. Each agent has a clear role and uses a powerful set of tools to perform its tasks.
- **The `PLAN -> ACT` Cycle**: All agents operate on a strict **Plan-then-Act** cycle. They first analyze the task and create a detailed, transparent plan of tool calls. Only after the plan is defined do they execute it, ensuring predictable and auditable behavior.
- **Orchestration with `Workflow Composer`**: For complex tasks, the `Workflow Composer` acts as a director, creating and managing multi-agent workflows. It sequences tasks, hands off work between agents, and enforces quality gates, turning a high-level goal into a fully managed, automated process.

## ‚ú® Features

- **ü§ñ Autonomous AI Agents**: A team of specialized agents for architecture, development, refactoring, debugging, and more.
- **üîÑ Predictable `PLAN -> ACT` Workflow**: Ensures transparency and reliability in all agent operations.
- **üéº Multi-Agent Orchestration**: The `Workflow Composer` designs and executes complex development workflows.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Based Execution**: Agents perform all actions through a well-defined set of tools (`shell_exec`, `replace_file_content`, `codebase_search`), eliminating guesswork.
- **üöÄ Automated Onboarding**: The `Onboarder` agent automates project setup, from dependency checks to initial tests.
- **üî¨ Scientific Debugging & Refactoring**: Dedicated agents apply systematic, safe, and verifiable methods to improve code quality.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Quality Gates**: The `Quality Monitor` and `RAG Assistant` ensure that all work meets predefined standards.
- **üß© Project Templates**: Production-ready starters for various application types, now with automated setup.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This framework is now managed via a powerful command-line interface (CLI). Follow these steps to get started.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher.
- Dependencies installed: `npm install`

### 2. Discover Available Agents

To see the full team of specialized agents available to you, run the `discover` command:

```bash
node scripts/avp-init.js discover
```

This will list all agents, their version, description, and capabilities, so you know who to assign to a task.

### 3. Define a Workflow

Create a JSON file (e.g., `my-workflow.json`) to define a sequence of tasks for the agents. Each step specifies the agent to use and the task to perform.

**Example `my-workflow.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "New Feature Workflow",
  "steps": [
    {
      "agentName": "Project Initializer",
      "description": "Initialize a new project",
      "task": { "projectName": "my-new-app" }
    },
    {
      "agentName": "Codebase Analyzer Agent",
      "description": "Analyze the new codebase",
      "task": { "projectPath": "./my-new-app" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Run the Workflow

Execute your workflow using the `workflow:run` command:

```bash
node scripts/avp-init.js workflow:run my-workflow.json
```

The CLI will execute each step, applying confidence gating to ensure quality and reliability. If an agent's confidence is too low, the workflow will halt for an audit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The CLI-Driven Workflow

Interaction with the framework is managed entirely through the CLI, providing a structured and repeatable process for complex tasks.

1.  **Discover Agents**: Use `avp discover` to identify the best agent for each part of your task.
2.  **Compose a Workflow**: Define a series of steps in a `.json` file. Each step assigns a task to a specific agent.
3.  **Execute with Confidence**: Run your workflow with `avp workflow:run <your-file.json>`. The system orchestrates the agents, and its confidence-gating system ensures each step meets quality standards before proceeding.

## ü§ñ The Agent Team

Our agents have been upgraded to be active participants in the development process.

- **`core/architect`**: Designs system architecture and creates technical plans for the `Developer`.
- **`core/developer`**: Implements features based on architectural plans, using its `frontend`, `backend`, and `testing` specialists.
- **`helpers/refactor-assistant`**: An active agent that uses tools like `file_apply_patch` and `shell_exec` to safely prepare code *before* new features are added.
- **`helpers/debugger-assistant`**: Uses a scientific method and tools to systematically find and fix bugs.
- **`helpers/quality-monitor`**: Automatically runs linters, tests, and security scans using `shell_exec` to enforce quality standards.
- **`helpers/onboarder`**: Automates the entire project setup process.
- **`helpers/workflow-composer`**: The team lead. Decomposes high-level goals into multi-agent workflows and orchestrates their execution.

...and many more specialized agents in the `agents` directory.
